OOPs concept in JavaScript.

## Description about OOPs

As JavaScript is widely used in Web Development, in this article we will explore some of the Object Oriented mechanisms supported by JavaScript to get the most out of it.
As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

 ## All OOPs concept one by one 
 
 ### Class and Object :-
  
  - Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesn’t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype. 
  - An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods. For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, type, model, and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving. The characteristics of an Object are called Properties in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are called methods. An Object is an instance of a class. Objects are everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object whether it is a function, array, or string.

 ### Abstraction :-
 
 - Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. Sometimes encapsulation refers to the hiding of data or data Abstraction which means representing essential features hiding the background detail. Most of the OOP languages provide access modifiers to restrict the scope of a variable, but there are no such access modifiers in JavaScript, there are certain ways by which we can restrict the scope of variables within the Class/Object.

### Encapsulation :-

 - The process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit is known as encapsulation.

 ### Inheritance :-
 
  -  It is a concept in which some properties and methods of an Object are being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Objects inherit Objects i.e. certain features (property and methods) of one object can be reused by other Objects.The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

  ### Polymorphism :-
  
  - Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. Polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding and method overloading. The Person and Student objects both have the same method (i.e toString()), this is called Method Overriding. Method Overriding allows a method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and method signature as that of a parent class. In the above code, the super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class’s instance variable.
